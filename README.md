# Challenges
A collection of short projects. These projects range in difficulty and come from different websites. Most come from Martyr's mega post. Currently written in Python and use "Pythonic" solutions.   

Pig Latin:  
--------------

Pig Latin is a game of alterations played on the English language game. To create the Pig Latin form of an English word the initial consonant sound is transposed to the end of the word and an ay is affixed (Ex.: "banana" would yield anana-bay). Read Wikipedia for more information on rules.

Count Vowels:  
--------------

Enter a string and the program counts the number of vowels in the text. For added complexity have it report a sum of each vowel found.

Check if Palindrome:  
--------------

Checks if the string entered by the user is a palindrome. That is that it reads the same forwards as backwards like “racecar”

Count Words in a String:  
--------------

Counts the number of individual words in a string. For added complexity read these strings in from a text file and generate a summary.  

Next Prime Number  
--------------  
Have the program find prime numbers until the user chooses to stop asking for the next one.

Fizz Buzz  
--------------  
Write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to n. But for multiples of three print “Fizz” instead of the number and for the multiples of five print “Buzz”. For numbers which are multiples of both three and five print “FizzBuzz”.  

Dictionary Error  
--------------  
A program that checks if a python dictionary will error on a given input and if so handles the exception.  

Calculator   
--------------  
Write a program given a string input evaluates the expression no matter the input.  

Collatz Conjecture  
--------------     
Start with a number n > 1. Find the number of steps it takes to reach one using the following process: If n is even, divide it by 2. If n is odd, multiply it by 3 and add 1.  
Caesar cipher  
--------------  

Implement a Caesar cipher, both encoding and decoding. The key is an integer from 1 to 25. This cipher rotates the letters of the alphabet (A to Z). The encoding replaces each letter with the 1st to 25th next letter in the alphabet (wrapping Z to A). So key 2 encrypts "HI" to "JK", but key 20 encrypts "HI" to "BC". This simple "monoalphabetic substitution cipher" provides almost no security, because an attacker who has the encoded message can either use frequency analysis to guess the key, or just try all 25 keys.   

Number Letter Counter  
--------------  
Write a program that accepts a sentence and calculate the number of letters and digits.  
Suppose the following input is supplied to the program:  
hello world! 123  
Then, the output should be:
LETTERS 10
DIGITS 3
